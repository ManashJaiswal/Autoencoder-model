ðŸ§  Autoencoder on MNIST Dataset

An Autoencoder model built using Machine Learning / Deep Learning techniques to learn compressed representations of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
This project demonstrates how autoencoders can be used for dimensionality reduction, noise removal, and feature learning.
